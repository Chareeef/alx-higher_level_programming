# Test-Driven Development Learning Project

Welcome to the Test-Driven Development (TDD) Learning Project! In this project, we'll cover key concepts related to test-driven development, including interactive tests, the importance of tests, writing docstrings for tests, creating documentation for modules and functions, basic options flags for tests, and finding edge cases. 

## 1. Introduction to TDD

Test-Driven Development is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. This helps ensure that the code meets the desired functionality and is free from defects.

## 2. Importance of Tests

Tests play a crucial role in software development. They help catch bugs early, ensure that changes don't break existing functionality, and provide a safety net for refactoring. By having comprehensive tests, you can have confidence in the reliability of your code.

## 3. Writing Docstrings for Tests

Docstrings are descriptive comments included in code to explain its purpose. When writing tests, it's important to create clear and informative docstrings that describe what the test is checking and the expected outcome.

Example:
```python
def test_addition():
    """Test the addition function."""
    result = addition(3, 5)
    assert result == 8, "Addition failed"
```

## 4. Documentation for Modules and Functions

Documentation is essential for helping other developers understand how to use your code. Include explanations of module purposes, function parameters, return values, and usage examples. This makes your codebase more maintainable and user-friendly.

Example:
```python
def addition(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first number.
    b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b
```

## 5. Basic Option Flags for Tests

When running tests, you can use various command-line flags to modify their behavior. Some common options include:

- `-v` or `--verbose`: Provides detailed output about the tests being run.
- `-k` or `--keyword`: Runs tests that match a specific keyword.
- `-x` or `--exitfirst`: Stops running tests after the first failure.

Example:
```
pytest -v -k addition
```

## 6. Finding Edge Cases

Edge cases are scenarios where the code might behave unexpectedly. It's important to identify and test these cases to ensure your code handles them correctly. Examples include using extreme values, empty inputs, or boundary conditions.

By focusing on these learning objectives, you'll gain a deep understanding of test-driven development and its core principles. Happy coding and testing!
